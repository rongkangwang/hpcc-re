\begin{abstract}
  Recently, VoIP applications win most of the users' favor with their high service quality and low price. However, owing to the flexible of VoIP services, it will cause incalculable damage if these services are used improperly. In order to make VoIP applications serve humans better, it is important to keep VoIP applications under supervision. The upgrading of VoIP technology makes the traditional identification method inefficient, it becomes more difficult to identify VoIP traffic. For the challenge of identifying VoIP traffic, the deep learning technology provides us a new solution. With supervised learning method, we can build feature set for identifing VoIP
  traffic. This way is not only able to find the most useful features, but also it can get rid of human effort in exploring features. In this paper, we adopt CLNN(Convolutional Neural Networks, Long Short-Term Memory) to extract features for accurate VoIP application identification. In addition, we design a real-time identification system to capture VoIP traffic in a large-scale network and identify their application types with the features we trained. The evaluation results verify that our system can identify VoIP traffic timely and accurately.

   %we propose a generic approach, which can capture VoIP voice traffic come from all kinds of VoIP applications (non-encrypted and encrypted) and determine source application of captured VoIP traffic in real time. Our approach uses deep learning to extract statistical features to build fingerprint library for all applications. Deep learning approach is able to find most useful features, in the meantime, it can get rid of human effort in exploring features. In addition, we design a real-time identification system to capture VoIP traffic and identify them in a large-scale network.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
VoIP(Voice over Internet Protocol) is an internet technology for the delivery of voice communications and media sessions over IP networks, it provides an environment supports connection of all kinds of terminals via internet. Recently, with their price advantage, VoIP applications have been used more and more among the people. Most of VoIP applications can provide convenient services, such as anonymous calls, multi-line calls, call forwarding. They are so flexible that many unruly elements use VoIP services make fraud calls. The results of VoIP identification researches can help network administrators to enhance network even society security. For these reasons, VoIP identification has been an active research topic.

%In some private networks, network traffic generated by VoIP applications need to be monitored. For us, we need to intercept specify VoIP applications at the international gateway. It is necessary to identify VoIP application traffic accurately, determine origin of VoIP traffic can help us deal with emergencies.

VoIP consists of the protocols that used in signaling and channel setup. H.323, SIP, MGCP and MEGACO are the most commonly used protocols for call signaling and controlling, RTP/RTCP is the most commonly used transmission protocol. Some researches \cite{14,16,13} are devoted to analyze the behavior of the VoIP traffic generated in signaling phase, some \cite{4,15} are devoted to analyze the behavior of the voice traffic that RTP/RTCP carries. There are also some large manufacturers using their own VoIP protocol, such as the Skype protocol. Therefore, there are some researches \cite{skype1,skype2,skype3} specifically identify Skype traffic. Unfortunately, encryption technologies such as SSL/TLS, WAP/WAP2 and SRTP/SRTCP is increasingly used to encrypt VoIP traffic. The utilization of encryption technologies has impact on both identification directions, identification task of VoIP traffic is getting harder and harder.

Encryption technologies are so mature that most VoIP applications already adopt them into signaling phase. Compared to signaling phase, SRTP/SRTCP require more computing resources than RTP/RTCP, considering calculation ability and transmission quality, most of the existing VoIP applications still adopt RTP/RTCP in voice transmission phase. As for encrypted voice traffic that few VoIP applications generate, we can extract more features than signaling traffic with deep learning method because of there are huge amounts of traffic generated in voice transmission phase. On the other hand, the development of MGCP and MEGACO protocols makes more VoIP applications adopt softswitch technology. It is unreliable to identify RTP/RTCP channel by analyze signaling traffic under NAT networks. For these reasons, we combine CNN and LSTM models which we called CLNN to extract features for flows generated during the voice transmission phase not the signaling phase.
%The flows generated by VoIP applications contain important temporal features, owing to LSTM is good at temporal modeling, we embed LSTM into CNN model to improve the performance of mining temporal features. The model we build is called CLNN model below.
Considering identification real-time performance, we separate the VoIP entire flows into subflows to extract features. In our real-time system, after a subflow is identified, subsequent traffic belonging to this flow will be identified.

Our contributions are summarized as follow: 1) We designed CLNN model to extract features for voice flows, the CLNN model is able to extract features in both time and frequency domains, the extracted features are more reliable than extracted by humans. 2) We can identify a VoIP flow in acceptable time, we train subflow dataset instead of entire flow, it is a necessary condition for real-time identification. 3) We designed a real-time identification system to be deployed in large-scale networks, administrators can intercept VoIP traffic according to identification results.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section \ref{sec:relatedwork}, we describe the previously published related works.  In section \ref{sec:methodology}, there are main methods used in our work.
%Then we present the architecture of our real-time identification system in section \ref{sec:architecture}.
In section \ref{sec:algorithms}, we introduce the algorithms used in this paper. The performance evaluation is shown in section \ref{sec:performanceevaluation}. The conclusion is shown in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.



%Unfortunately, the upgrading of VoIP technology makes identification task more difficult. In most of VoIP applications, SIP or H.323 protocol is used in call connection phase, RTP/RTCP protocol is used in voice transmission phase. Encryption technologies such as SSL/TLS, SIPS, WEP and WAP/WAP2 may be used to encrypt call connections, SRTP/SRTCP may be used to encrypt voice transmission. Identifying VoIP traffic is getting harder and harder. It is urgent to find a more effective and more generic way for identifying VoIP traffic.

%And VoIP applications are different from applications like HTTP, DNS, which use standard port.

%Encryption technologies are so mature that most VoIP applications already adopt them into signaling phase. Compared to signaling phase, SRTP/SRTCP require more computing resources than RTP/RTCP, considering calculation ability and transmission quality, most of the existing VoIP applications still adopt RTP/RTCP in voice transmission phase. For encrypted voice traffic that few VoIP applications generate, we can extract more features than signaling traffic because of there are more traffic generated in voice transmission phase. For these reasons, we adopt CNN to extract features for flows generated during the voice transmission phase. Considering identification real-time performance, we separate the VoIP entire flows into sub flows to train CNN model. In our real-time system, after a flow is identified, subsequent traffic belonging to this flow will be identified.

%Our contributions of this paper are summarized as follow: 1) We adopt CNN to extract features for voice flows, these extracted features are not only more reliable than the features extracted by humans, but also greatly improve the identification efficiency. 2) We can identify VoIP flows in an acceptable time, we train CNN model with sub flows instead of entire flows, it is a necessary condition for real-time identification. 3) These extracted features can accurately identify the application types of VoIP flows, in real network environments, administrators can intercept VoIP traffic according to specify application type.

%In this paper, our main goal is to find a way to detect VoIP traffic and determine VoIP traffic's original application. It is impossible to identify traffic using call signaling which is encrypted using SSL/TLS, WEP and WAP/WAP2 in call connection phase. We adopt a method that only relies on the traffic generated during the voice transmission phase. Deep Learning provides us with ideas to solve the this problem.
%Zhanyi Wang \cite{1} proposed the application of Deep Learning on traffic identification.
%The features extracted by deep learning are not only more reliable than the features extracted by humans, but also greatly improve the identification efficiency.

%The concept of real time mentioned in this article is relative, if we can identify the source application of a call flow in an acceptable time, we think it is real time. Many researchers identify VoIP applications by extracting the characteristics of bidirectional voice transmission stream, it is not feasible for real-time identification. Therefore, we proposed a method to extract features for multiple continuous packets generated within seconds or even a few milliseconds.

%we can do feature extraction for the traffic generated within seconds or even a few milliseconds and apply the extracted features to real-time identification.
%We need to extract the most accurate features in the shortest possible time for VoIP traffic identification. To make the features more reliable, we proposed a method to extract features for multiple continuous packets.

%The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In section \ref{sec:relatedwork}, we describes the previously published related works.  In section \ref{sec:methodology}, there is a brief introduction to several methods used in this paper. Then we present the architecture of our real-time identification system in section \ref{sec:architecture}. In sections \ref{sec:trafficcollectionandprocessing}, \ref{sec:learningusingdeeplearningmodel} and \ref{sec:realtimeidentification}, we describe the dataset and model used for deep learning, and how to perform real-time identification. The performance evaluation is shown in section \ref{sec:performanceevaluation}. The conclusion is shown in section \ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relatedwork}

%Traffic identification has been an active research topic in the past decade. The identification of VoIP has attracted the attention of many researches and there are lots of worthy results obtained.

Since early VoIP applications use the ports that IANA designated, some previous works identify VoIP traffic based on ports. With the development of VoIP applications, most of them use dynamic ports, the traditional identification method based on port numbers is not effective enough. To overcome these difficulties, some researches \cite{14,16} identify specify protocol with their regular characteristics, such as SIP, RTP. \cite{18} uses DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) way to extract application-level signatures to detect VoIP applications. These kinds of works are too limited to identify private protocol like Skype protocol. Also, the above methods cannot identify VoIP applications adopt encryption technologies.

Statistical analysis method is another most frequently used method to detect VoIP traffic. Some characteristics such as packet-inter arrival time, packet size and rate of packet exchange are analyzed and used to detect VoIP traffic in \cite{2}. Authors in \cite{19} combine traffic flow statistic analysis with host behavior estimation. They set a parameter D to filter non-VoIP traffic out and calculate the R by EL (large inter-packet time) and ES (small inter-packet time) to identify VoIP traffic. There are still some latest researches \cite{20,21} adopt rule-based and statistical analysis-based solution to detect VoIP traffic. These ways require many thresholds to be set for corresponding rules to identify VoIP traffic, it's powerless for a wide variety of VoIP applications. With the development of machine learning, this method has gained its new vitality. In \cite{5}, authors propose the machine learning approach to identify encrypted VoIP traffic. They build flow-based feature set and employ 3 learning algorithms for training dataset, the results show a good performance to classify VoIP traffic. Usually this type of statistical analysis methods aim at detecting VoIP traffic, which means identify VoIP traffic in VoIP/non-VoIP level. With machine learning methods, it can achieve further classification in application level. The method proposed in \cite{5} trains the classifier with entire flows, and it requires a lot of works to build feature set. So they hardly could be used for real-time identification.

There are several researches trying to identify VoIP traffic in real time. For detecting VoIP traffic quickly, the packets whose length in range of 60 to 150 bytes are treated as VoIP packets in \cite{3}. This method only aims at improving VoIP service quality, it cannot be used for accurate VoIP identification. A method that identifies peer-to-peer VoIP sessions using entropy and codec properties is proposed in \cite{4}, they consider several applications and their corresponding codecs so that the classifier can identify a VoIP session with the specific codec it uses. Moreover, they focus on the relation between the different lengths of N packets and explore their level of heterogeneity using entropy. In order to guarantee the real-time of the classifier, they adopt a sliding window with a constant size of N packets to access the heterogeneity in real time. Same real-time identification method used in \cite{22}, authors extract the PSD (Packet Size Distribution) of the first few packets of the entire Bi-flow. Results show this method can identify Bi-flow quickly after its establishment. All such methods that real-time identify VoIP traffic are based on features of sub-flows, but the limited features is too powerless to identify VoIP traffic in a tiny time period.

%Khan, F. I. U. A. (2008) \cite{2} proposed a generic technique for VoIP traffic detection. They analyze the characteristics of packet-inter arrival time, packet size and rate of packet exchange in the whole voice transmission stream. Their main goal is to use generic features to distinguish between VoIP traffic and other types of traffic. The following conclusions are given in this paper: Average packets/Sec rate is greater in VoIP as compared to other applications; Average packet size in bytes is small in VoIP as compared to other applications. Their method is important in detecting VoIP traffic, but it cannot be used for identify specific VoIP applications. Our main goal is to further identify specific original application for VoIP traffic.

%Yildirim, T., \& Radcliffe, P. J. (2010, August) \cite{3} proposed a method that can detect VoIP traffic quickly, this method is aiming at improving VoIP service quality. Packets whose length in range of 60 to 150 bytes are treated as VoIP packets. The article is mainly aimed at improving the quality of VoIP services, so detecting efficiency has a higher priority than accuracy. This method cannot be used for identify specific VoIP applications either, and the length of traffic generated by latest VoIP application is no longer limited to 60-150 bytes. In our research, the length of packets of several applications is more than 200. But it still is a simple and effective way to help us extract VoIP traffic in all kinds of network traffic.

%Gomes, J. V., In$\acute{a}$cio, P. R., Pereira, M., Freire, M. M., \& Monteiro, P. P. (2013) \cite{4} proposed a method that identifies Peer-to-Peer VoIP sessions using entropy and codec properties. The mechanism classifies the VoIP flows, in real-time, based on the speech codec used in the session. Classifier does not use the lengths of the packets individually, it explores their level of heterogeneity using entropy to emphasize such feature. Different codecs used by different VoIP applications are listed, and the lengths of the payloads and the entropy of the first three minutes of VoIP sessions using different CBR or VBR codecs are drawn in this paper. The results of the performance evaluation shows this method can identify VoIP sessions accurately. The proposed method is able to identify VoIP applications in real-time, it is similar to our goal. 3 minutes are still too long to identify VoIP traffic for our requirement. We want to improve the effectiveness and accuracy using deep learning.

%Alshammari, R., \& Zincir-Heywood, A. N. (2015) \cite{5} structure feature sets for traffic excluding payload. The traffic is complete bidirectional flow between client and server. In this paper, fiat(forward inter-arriaval time), biat(backward inter-arriaval time), fpkt(forward packet length), bpkt(backward packet length), proto and duration etc. are listed. And researchers are trying to train dataset using 3 supervised learning methods, C5.0, Ada Boost and Genetic Programming. The results show C5.0 is better than the others, for Skype, it achieves 100\% DR, the other VoIP application achieves more than 90\% too. This paper lists so many features for complete voice flow, we want to collect more features just for a short voice flow using deep learning, so that classifier can be more accurate and effective.

%Zhanyi Wang \cite{1} proposed the application of Deep Learning on traffic identification. They think it is difficult and time-consuming to find the features for traffic identification. They propose a method based on neural network and deep learning, and they apply the method to protocol classification and unknown protocol identification, all of the results show the deep learning method works very well on protocol classification. Their method provide us a idea to identify VoIP traffic in real time.

Standing on the shoulders of prior researches and focusing on the difficulties we found, in this paper we try to extract features for huge amounts of data with deep learning technology. Based on the deep learning technology proposed in \cite{1}, we employ CLNN model to help us extract features automatically. These features are generic for non-encrypted and encrypted VoIP applications. The identification system we build can preliminarily detect VoIP traffic based on some rules, then the classifier can classify VoIP traffic into accurate application type.

%There are several differences between our method and above methods: 1) we use deep learning to extract feature set. The feature set is more credible than extracted by human; 2) IP and UDP header are not included in our dataset. The reason why we do not use them is the development of NAT technology and network proxy technology make the identification based on IP address limited and VoIP applications always use non-specific port; 3) we only use a limited number of packets to identify application. This is the basis of our real-time identification. Based on these differences, our method has several advantages, automatic generation of feature set, generic for non-encrypted and encrypted VoIP applications, used for real-time identification.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

VoIP applications use RTP to transfer data, RTP typically runs over UDP. What we need to do is not only to identify RTP traffic from a large amount of UDP traffic, but also to identify VoIP traffic from RTP traffic. The ability to identify single VoIP packet is very low, so we identify VoIP traffic by identifying the flow it belongs to. Both offline training phase and online identification phase are based on this point, we introduce our methods for these 2 phases separately.

\subsection{Offline Training}
\label{sec:offlinetraining}
In offline training phase, we adopt supervised learning method to extract features, which are used in online identification phase. In order to verify VoIP flows carry the features supporting identification, we did some basic researches. Firstly, VoIP applications will select appropriate codecs based on network conditions or channel types, and the codecs supported by each VoIP application are different. The codecs we found in our dataset lists in Table~\ref{tab:codecs}. The payload type in RTP header indicates the codec, this basic network feature can be used to identify VoIP traffic. Secondly, different codecs will occupy different bandwidth, in the meantime, different packing periods make VoIP applications to have different sending rates. Both PSD \cite{22} and entropy \cite{4} are related to codecs and packing times. In addition, ITD(Interarrival Time Distribution) and PTD(Packet Type Distribution) are different for each application. Except these features, there are many other features can be used for identifying.

\begin{table}[htbp]

    Bria      & PCM A/U, Speex, GSM  \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

In order to design a model extracting the most useful features for VoIP flow identification, we reasearched the most popular CNN models such as LeNet-5~\cite{6}, AlexNet~\cite{8}, VGG~\cite{9}, GoogleNet~\cite{10} and ResNet~\cite{11}. CNN models have the ability to reduce frequency variations, so they are often used for digit recognition. By contrast, LSTM is good at temporal modeling and often used for speech recognition. LSTM as a development of RNN is proposed for solving the gradient problem in RNN model~\cite{lstm}. To extract the most useful features in both time and frequency domains, we design a deep learning model based on CNN and LSTM, we name it as CLNN model. Like many existing deep learning models, most of the CNN ideas come from AlexNet. The difference is we employ LSTM for improving temporal features. CNN and LSTM layers extract the features of frequency and time domain respectively before they are input into fully connected layers. Figure~\ref{fig:cnnlstm} shows how CLNN model works.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{cnnlstm.eps}
\caption{Basic principles for extracting representations with CLNN model.}\label{fig:cnnlstm}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The way to extract features for entire VoIP flows cannot be used for real-time VoIP identification, we split entire VoIP flows into subflows. One subflow is consist of $k$ continuous VoIP packets from the same channel, we use $subflow^k$ denoting one in the following sections. We design a sampling method that uses sliding window to select $subflow^k$ into training dataset, the sliding window can select its next step length randomly. This method not only promises the dataset is uniform but also reduces the training work. 



\subsection{Online Identification}
\label{sec:onlineidentification}
The offline training work is the basis of online identification, the features we get in offline training are used for identifying VoIP flows. In online identification phase, we parse the \{srcIP, dstIP, srcPort, dstPort\} in IP and UDP header, the quad-tuple is used to separate flows as a key. We generate a $subflow^k$ for each flow with their specific key, then we identify the $subflow^k$ with the online identification system. For each flow with specific key, the identification result is saved as the value of the key. The \{key, value\} is saved into our database, we can identify the following traffic with their quad-tuple.

We design an online identification system for large-scale networks, there are 3 main components in this system. The basic architecture is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:online_architecture_new}. Capturer capture UDP packets and separate them into corresponding flows by IP address and UDP port. Filter follows several rules to filter out obvious non-VoIP flows. Classifier classifies flows into corresponding application type with extracted features. 
\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{online_architecture_new.eps}
\caption{Architecture of online real-time identification system.}\label{fig:online_architecture_new}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

We adopt Apache Storm as our stream processing computation engine, and Apache Kafka as backup and load balance system to interact with networks. Figure~\ref{fig:storm} shows the Storm topology of our system. There is a Kafka Spout as the Kafka consumer client to consume the traffic from the network. A Bolt as capturer, a Bolt to distribute pending flows to next Bolt, the subsequent Bolt may be a filter or a classifier, which is determined by our settings based on k. The last Bolt RedisWriter is in charge of writing the identification results to the Redis database, and in order to get more accurate identification result, the result in database will be replaced by the classifier that gets higher probability.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{storm.eps}
\caption{Storm topology of online identification system.}\label{fig:storm}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

%In this paper, we extract features for subflows (we use $subflow^k$ to denote one in the following) which consist of several continuous VoIP packets from a VoIP flow. In real-time identification phase, we build a $subflow^k$ after a connection established and apply the features to identify the $subflow^k$.

\section{Algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}
\label{sec:datapreprocessing}
We collect raw VoIP traffic and contruct $subflow^k$ dataset with our sampling method. We adopt different $k$ as the size of sliding window to select $subflow^k$ into our dataset. When the window size is $k$, the next step is randomized in [1, k]. It ensures that our dataset isn't overly similar or vague. Figure~\ref{fig:dataset} shows how we select 4 $subflow^k$ for $k=10$.
\begin{figure}[htp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{dataset.eps}
\caption{How to process raw traffic to build $subflow^k$ dataset(k=10).}\label{fig:dataset}
\end{center}
\end{figure}


The $subflow^k$ we select are processed to matrices, these matrices as training data are input into CLNN model. We have 5 steps to convert a $subflow^k$ to matrix. 1) Remove IP and UDP header; 2) Add 2 timestamps to each packet, one is the time difference from the first packet, the other one is the time difference from the previous packet; 3) Add 0 to denote forward direction of the traffic transmission, 255 to denote the backward direction; 4) Convert the $subflow^k$ to matrix on the basis of ASCII code; 4) Normalize the matrix, the timestamps and direction types what we add are normalized too. The length of VoIP packets is generally small around 50$\sim$210, so we set column of the matrix to 256. The row of the matrix is $k$, indicating a $subflow^k$ includes k packets.

\subsection{CLNN model}
Based on section~\ref{sec:datapreprocessing}, the input of CLNN model is matrices with size of $k \times l$, where $k$ is number of packets used for $subflow^k$, $l$ is the column of matrix, we use 256. We empoly 2 LSTM layers, where each layer has 512 hidden cells. And we employ 5 CNN layers in parallel, the parameters of each CNN layer is similar with AlexNet. We adjust the filter kernel to $5 \times 5$ in the first layer, and we change the padding type to same in each layer. We only use 1 max pooling after the first layer. After the 5\textsuperscript{th} CNN layer, there are 1 flatten layer to reshape features into one-dimension and 1 fully connection layer to extract features preliminary. The features extracted by LSTM and CNN parts are concatenated and input into fully connection layers, the fully connection layer has 2048 hidden units. The concatenated features are input into fully connection layer with 2048 hidden units. The last layer as the output layer is activated using Softmax function, the sample will be classified into 11 classes.

\subsection{Learning}
We use SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) optimizer to minimize the loss function in this paper, and apply nesterov momentum to update gradient after every iteration. The formula of gradient increment shown as follow,
\begin{equation}
\Delta {X_t} = \tau {M_{t - 1}} - \eta \nabla f({X_{t - 1}} + \tau {M_{t - 1}})
\end{equation}
where ${\tau}$ denotes the factor of momentum, ${\eta}$ denotes learning rate. ${g_t} = \nabla f({X_{t - 1}} + \tau {M_{t - 1}})$ is the gradient of transition point, where $\Delta {X_t}$ denotes the real decreasing displacement, ${X_t}$ denotes the position at time t, ${M_t}$ denotes the momentum at time t.

In our work, learning rate decays after each epoch, decay rule is shown as:
\begin{equation}
{\eta _i} = {\eta _{i - 1}} \times \frac{1}{{1 + \rho  \times i}}
\end{equation}
where ${\rho }$ denotes the decay factor, i denotes the number of epoch.

During the training, we train data to find the most optimal weights to maximize the likelihood estimate of $subflow^k$. To minimize the CCE (categorical cross-entropy), we have the formula as follow,
\begin{equation}
CCE({V_i}) =  - \sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {P({V_i}) \times \log (\hat P({V_i}))}
\end{equation}
where $P({V_i})$ denotes the real probability ${V_i}$, it is the target matrix generated according to the labels corresponding to the training data. $P({V_j})=1$, where j is the label corresponding to VoIP application that this $subflow^k$ belongs.$P({V_i})=0$,where $i \ne j$.

We use Softmax function as the activation function in the last layer. There are 11 types of traffic in our experiment, we calculate the posterior probability for unknown flow to identify its application type. Softmax function shows as
\begin{equation}
\hat P({V_i}) = softmax({V_i}) = \frac{{{e^{{V_i}}}}}{{\sum\limits_{j = 1}^n {{e^{{V_j}}}} }}
\end{equation}
where $({V_1},{V_2},{\rm{\cdot\cdot\cdot,}}{V_i},{\rm{\cdot\cdot\cdot}},{V_n})$ denotes the matrix to be inputted into Softmax in the 8th layer; $(\hat P({V_1}),\hat P({V_2}),{\rm{\cdot\cdot\cdot}},\hat P({V_i}),{\rm{\cdot\cdot\cdot}},\hat P({V_n}))$ is the output of the 8th layer, it is posterior probability distribution of $subflow^k$, it is a vector with size of $1 \times n$; n is 11 in our experiment, it denotes the number of training traffic types.

\subsection{Components in Identification System}

The first component capturer maintain a pending flows queue and map packet into its matching pending flow using its IP address and UDP port. Figure~\ref{fig:flow} shows the details to separate flows by IP address and UDP port. If a packet cannot find the corresponding pending flow, it creates a new pending flow and adopt IP address and UDP port as its key. If a packet is appended into pending flow, and the number of packet reaches k, this $subflow^k$ will be sent to next component filter. The capturer guarantees that all captured packets are UDP packets, and the capturer can remove dead flows from pending flows queue. Flows whose number of packets doesn't reach k within limited time will be considered as dead flows.

The second component is a rule-based filter, it receives $subflow^k$ sent by capturer. Because non-VoIP flows are no value to us, it will be filtered out to a certain extent. The remaining flows will be sent to next component to do further identification. We select benchmark values from our dataset and set several rules based on these benchmark values. Related algorithm and parameters are shown in Algorithm~\ref{algorithm:filter} and Table~\ref{tab:rules}.

The $subflow^k$ that pass through filter successfully will be input into the third component classifier, the features used by the classifier are extracted in offline training phase. 4 kinds of classifiers are trained by SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree, we select SVM classifier which have the best performance into our real-time system. The classifier takes k-dimensional matrix as input and output a vector whose size is $1 \times n$,  n denotes the number of VoIP applications that our identification model can identify. The vector indicates a $subflow^k$'s likelihood estimation for every VoIP application. The index of the maximum value in the vector is the identification result. The classifier can set the identification result in database, subsequent packets will be identified by querying the database. In the process of identification, one flow will pass through multiple k-classifiers when it grows up to different k stages, these classifiers will give their own identification results and corresponding possibilities.



\section{Performance evaluation}
\label{sec:performanceevaluation}
In this section, we introduce the dataset used in our experiment firstly. Secondly, we give the specific parameters used in the CLNN model. Finally, we show the experimental results and give the evaluation of the system performance.
\subsection{Dataset}
\label{sec:dataset}
Collecting VoIP traffic is the beginning of all of the works. In order to get raw traffic of 10 VoIP applications mentioned above, we deploy 8 computers installed 10 kinds of VoIP applications. We installed 6 computers with Windows operating system, the others 2 computers installed with Linux operating system, because there are only 4 applications can be installed on Linux platform. We can establish ordinary VoIP calls among them, and all of them can dial the phone number directly. There are 4 phones ready to be called. We try our best to make calls from various places in the country to improve the credibility of our experiment. Besides, we collect the traffic from various video and game software as non-VoIP traffic. We divide the captured traffic into two equal parts, the first part is preprocessing into subflow dataset when the second part is used for replaying by tcpreplay software to examine online identification system.

Obtaining pure dataset and labeling dataset accurately are the basis of training good model. We adopt some traffic capture tools which are process-based. They can help us get pure raw traffic for each application, and we can label our dataset using the name of VoIP applications. We use the process-based capture tool QPA under Windows operating system; We use tcpdump to capture traffic based on port, which can be known after process occupied. QPA provide GUI application under Windows OS, it is easy to use for capturing traffic for a single process. Under Linux platform, we need to analyze the ports VoIP application uses, then we use command like ``tcpdump -i eth\_name trans\_protocol port port\_id" to capture traffic of specific ports. Because of process-based and port-based capture methods, it is easy to get pure raw traffic and label subflows with their corresponding process name.


We construct $subflow^k$ dataset with 8 different k, including 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 100. It is used for training 8 CLNN models. The details of training dataset is shown in Table~\ref{tab:traffic}. The forth column shows the number of $subflow^k$ where k is 10, definitely, we also process the dataset according to k is 2, 5, 10, 20 and so on. It decides the first dimension of the matrix that will be input into CLNN model. 80\% of the $subflow^k$ are used for training when 20\% used for validating in training pahse.

\subsection{Training Setting}
\label{sec:trainingsetting}

The optimization algorithm SGD used in training phase is a learning rate non-adaptive algorithm, the setting of learning rate has a direct impact on the experimental results. We learn from the general experience of deep learning, and we adjust it according to our experimental results. The initial learning rate is set to 0.01, it decays after 2 epochs following the rules mentioned in section 6.3. Nesterov updates based on the gradient, we set momentum factor to 0.9. We train the dataset 20 epochs with batch size 50, 100 and 200. Table~\ref{tab:params} shows the number and storage size of weights identification model.

The training is carried out on a machine with 24G RAM and a quad-core Intel processor of 3.6GHz. The machine is equipped with NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070(8GB) to accelerate computing. CUDA Toolkit 8.0 is used in our experiment to support parallel computing.


\subsection{Experiment Results}
\label{sec:experimentresults}
The dataset listed in Section~\ref{sec:dataset} is used to train, the numbers of subflows used to train are same for 8 different $k$. With the parameters setting in Section~\ref{sec:trainingsetting}, we get 8 CLNN models. The training and validating accuracies are shown in Table~\ref{tab:acc4models}. As the table shows, identification accuracy is correlated with batch size and packets number. Smaller batch size is able to get higher accuracy, but it takes more time in training phase. Identifying subflows with more packets will get higher accuracy, but a higher $k$ means also reduce the real-time performance of identification system. We need to balance the training time, real-time performance and identification accuracy in different scenarios.

For the above 8 CLNN models, we use TPR (True Positive Rate) to evaluate them. TPR reflects the probability of positive samples are identified correctly.
%TPR can be computed by Equation 5.
%\begin{equation}
%TPR = \frac{{TP}}{{TP + FN}}
%\end{equation}
%And FPR can be computed by Equation 6.
%\begin{equation}
%FPR = \frac{{FP}}{{FP + TN}}
%\end{equation}

\begin{figure*}[htp]
\begin{center}

\caption{The performance of the 8 CLNN models shown by TPR.}\label{fig:fprtpr}
\end{center}
\end{figure*}

Figure~\ref{fig:fprtpr} shows the performace of the 8 CLNN models for each VoIP application. VoIP traffic with obvious identification features can be accurately identified even k value is small, the accuracies of Skype, Xlite and Jumblo can reach above 90\% when k is 2. VoIP applications with very similar statistical features need more packets to support identification. For example, both Eyebeam and ExpressTalk adopt ITU-T G.711 PCMU as their codec, but these 2 VoIP applications adopt different packing times. So identifying them requires more temporal domain features, which means a higher k. The last chart shows the probability distribution of the true samples, which true samples means a $subflow^k$ is identified correctly. The connection line is connecting mean, it reflects a higher k can get a more credible identification results.

%In our experiment, the identification rate for dataset1 is close to 1. When we examine these 8 models with dataset2, there are some outliers. They can be seen in the first 4 charts shown on Figure~\ref{fig:fprtpr}, model-20 for Skype, model-4 for Xlite and so on. This means these models that we trained is overfitting the dataset. In the future research, we consider add the L1-norm and L2-norm into our model, we will merge dataset2 into dataset1 to enlarge dataset to avoid overfitting. Apart from this, these charts show good performance to most of VoIP applications.

The first chart in figure~\ref{fig:tf} shows the probability distribution of true samples and false samples(batch size=100). The CLNN models don't have the ability to identify unknown VoIP samples, so we identified 1000 known VoIP and 1000 unknow VoIP samples. The probability distribution of known VoIP samples and unknown VoIP samples shows in the second chart. We can see the probabilities of the true samples or known VoIP samples are generally greater than false samples and unknown VoIP samples, it's a condition to judge credibility of identification results. 
%which true result means a $subflow^k$ is identified correctly and false result means a $subflow^k$ is identified incorrectly.
%It shows the maximum probabilities of true results are generally close to 1, and they are disperse from 0.2 to 0.98.

We use the feature set we extracted by CLNN model to train classifiers with 4 machine learning models, the accuracy of them are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:ml}. The previous research we mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:relatedwork}, they use machine learning methods and feature set extracted by human to identify VoIP traffic. With our feature set extracted by CLNN model, the accuracy is up to 98\% or even higher when k is higher than 10.

  \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{ml.eps}

SVM has the best identification performance in these 4 machine learning methods. Although the accuracy of SVM is slightly lower than the CLNN model, but its real-time performance is better than original CLNN model. So we deploy classifiers trained by SVM into real network. We count the time consumed for identifying 100 VoIP flows with our system. Time consumed is shown on Table~\ref{tab:time4folws}. From this table we can see that it costs 3 seconds when k is 100, it is tolerate for a long call which lasts for minutes. For that call which end quickly, make identification time shorter is more valuable, classifiers with smaller k will obtain identification results faster. In general, the real-time performace is enough for VoIP long connections.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In our work, we propose a generic approach to real-time identify traffic of specific VoIP applications. We train classifiers with feature set extracted by CLNN model and deploy these classifiers into our real-time identification system. The real-time system is deployed with stream processing computation framework Apache Storm and it shows good performance. For now, the VoIP applications mentioned in this paper only cover the applications that can directly dial cell phone, some other applications using the VoIP protocol may be judged wrong or judged as non-VoIP applications. Our next goal is to enrich the types of VoIP applications. Similarly, the types of non-VoIP traffic need to be as rich as possible too. Another weak point is that training is too time consuming, if network administrators want to add new VoIP applications, the feature set need to be trained again. Given that the main goal of our mission is to intercept specific VoIP traffic in real time, the current system has achieved new breakthroughs in identification accuracy.
